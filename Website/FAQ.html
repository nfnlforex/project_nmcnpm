                          research, practice, and education to hold

                          they are active spaces for people to share ideas,
                          strategies, and the practice of learning. These
                          conferences, therefore, increase the likelihood
                          of sharing cutting-edge research findings,
                          innovative teaching methods, evidence-based
                          diagnoses, and treatment options. This is
                          essential for improving teaching quality and
                          student learning.</p>

                          expand their professional knowledge and
                          strengthen skills. On the other hand, educational
                          conferences create networking channels. Here,
                          participants communicate and collaborate, hence
                          building a community of practice that is full of
                          support. These conferences create an environment
                          of collaboration and knowledge-sharing.
                          Therefore, plays are essential in driving

                          Scopus Indexed journals</a> are those indexed in
                          Scopus, the largest generic database for
                          peer-reviewed literature. Scopus users are
                          researchers, academicians, and research centers
                          that use the platform to identify relevant
                          literature and track changes in research
                          directions across different disciplines. The
                          Scopus bibliographic database covers journals
                          from multidisciplinary fields such as medicine,
                          engineering, healthcare, education, and more.</p>
                          <p align="justify">Scopus-listed subscriptions
                          can bring many benefits to the journals as they
                          broaden their visibility, authority, and impact
                          in the academic community. The writers also
                          receive benefits from publishing in
                          Scopus-indexed journals, and the prominence and
                          reach of their research are increased. Moreover,
                          Scopus offers researchers and academies a gateway
                          to reliable data, metrics, and analytical tools.
                          Further, it helps them in the development of
                          research and education objectives as well as the
                          determination and prioritization of research

                          a journal is Scopus-indexed, simply visit the

                          page, you can find specific journals by title,
                          ISSN, or publisher.</p>

                          The "Indexed in Scopus" badge is a confirmation
                          that the journal is authentic, as it is on
                          Scopus' official website. Another verification

                          Source Title list. Additionally, book Title List

                          City of Shenzhen was selected as a venue for ICCV
                          2025 because of several good reasons. Primarily,
                          regarding computer vision, there is a significant
                          and prosperous community in the Greater Bay Area

                          and researchers in the field. Furthermore,
                          Shenzhen is known as the conference
                          infrastructure of world-class standards,
                          providing a convenient and professional setup for

                          <p align="justify">The city of Shenzhen is also
                          famous for its cozy climate, lots of tourist
                          spots, and delicious cuisine, which makes the
                          conference attendees really want to stay there
                          longer. As far as public transport is concerned,
                          Shenzhen Convention & Exhibition Center is
                          situated opposite a metro station with many bus
                          routes that run nearby. Finally, the convenient
                          access to the international airport and ferry
                          terminals is another good thing about Shenzhen as
                          far as hosting the conference is concerned.
                          Generally, the mixture of conveniences,
                          transportation accessibility, and communal
                          support is the reason that makes Shenzhen a

                          Rome has been chosen as the venue of ECC 2025
                          because of its rich heritage, cultural
                          significance, and enthusiastic research community
                          in the field of computer vision. While being the
                          capital of Italy, Rome presents a refreshing mix

                          proximity to international airports, smooth
                          public transportation system, and multiple
